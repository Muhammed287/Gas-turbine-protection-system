# Gas-turbine-protection-system
It is a prototype of a special protection system for gas turbines that generate electricity in large plants, and it is designed to measure and control three parameters, namely pressure, temperature and fuel consumption. When the pressure or temperature rises or falls below their usual level, or there is a change in the amount of fuel consumed, the control unit takes several actions as follows: * The turbine rotation speed has been reduced by thirty percent. * The first alarm, which is the yellow light alarm, is launched for two minutes. * If the operator does not respond to the first alarm, the second alarm is triggered, which is the red light alarm in addition to the acoustic alarm, and the turbine is stopped.
